# Open Battery Information

This project aims to provide tools and information about various batteries in order to aid repair. 
It is very common for manufacturers to lock the BMS when a fault is detected to protect the device and the user. Very important feature!
So when is it a problem? Well, there is always a chance for false triggering of this protection, or the fault could have been temporary or even repaired. 
In this case it would be wasteful to throw out a perfectly good BMS just because its software says it is faulty.

This is the problem we would like to solve!
