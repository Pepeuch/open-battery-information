# Open Battery Information

This project aims to provide tools and information about various batteries in order to aid repair. 
It is very common for manufacturers to lock the BMS when a fault is detected to protect the device and the user. Very important feature!
So when is it a problem? Well, there is always a chance for false triggering of this protection, or the fault could have been temporary or even repaired. 
In this case it would be wasteful to throw out a perfectly good BMS just because its software says it is faulty.

This is the problem we would like to solve!

## ArduinoOBI

Because of critical custom timings needed for the OneWire interface, we decided to make a simple Arduino Interface to handle this function. The source code can be find in this repository.

## Support

I have spent alot of time on this project and now releasing all this information to the public in hope that it will help other people save batteries and money. If you would like to show some appreciation for my work, please consider supporting me by buying me a coffee or sponsor me on Github!
